# = done
@ = fuhhh nah
main attractions:
a) #perception pixel art
b) @spinning disks
c) #light art (use shadows to make an image on wall)
d) #scaling room (objects look like they are getting bigger/smaller when moving)
e) #dragon that always looks at you
f) #anamorphic art (computer graphics illusion)
g) @neon spinning tunnel
h) #impossible object collections(like the gray rectangles on the project proposal)
i) 3D crossed eyed illusions
j) #protruding pyramids that look like hallways 


ordering:
1.
e) dragon that always looks at you 4

2.
g) neon spinning tunnel
/
i) 3D crossed eyed illusions 4 (1-4 with increasing complexity to see)

3.
a) perception pixel art 2
b) spinning disks 3

4.
c) light art (use shadows to make an image on wall) 2

5.
d) scaling room (objects look like they are getting bigger/smaller when moving in the room)

6.
f1) depth perception art (make a basic flat wall appear as a path to another room)

7.
f2*) still depth perception, but make it blend with the wall and pillars to make one image. blue dot is viewing spot
h) impossible object collections(like the gray rectangles on the project proposal) 3
j) protruding pyramids that look like hallways (3 on same panel)

teleports back to start




DON"T IMPLEMENT BELOW : 
(1 and 2 would require making a user model)
1) color room: displays shadows created when stepping inside from 3 RGB lights
2) mirror illusions?
- infinite pentagon prism
- anomalous mirror symmetry illusions
- small mirror maze that confuses user
